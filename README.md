# RPSLS-UI

This app was made using facebook's [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app). It was too large to just upload to Github, so to test the source code, follow the instructions in the link to set up an app, then replace the folder named "src" with the src folder from this repository.

If you just want to try the deployment version, there is a build folder included as well.

This react UI will be expecting the flask server from [RPSLS](https://github.com/briankaufman990/RPSLS) to be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. if you want to change it to a different end point, modify line 67 of App.js in src.
